Data Structures so far covered: Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Queue

Assignment:

Take a few .csv files. Place them to a data structure (I picked stack for no particular reason). 
It could have been any of the above mentioned because in this case it is only 4 files and order
makes no difference.
Then I transfered data to arraylist. Arraylist has nice funtionalities for convertion.
The main structure used by source code is linkedlist. I used linkedlist because there is a 
convinient functionality for transfer into .csv I cound have used queue, but I decided not to 
because the list had to be sorted which defeats the purpose of queue dynamics. 
Finally I transfered data to a .csv file. It's sorted by song title. 

The functional calls are:

sort by song, print to file, print to terminal, play song, list recently played songs and 
see last played song.
